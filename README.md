# F1TENTH_Auxiliaries
The F1TENTH_Auxiliaries repository is a collection of essential helper tools and resources created to facilitate the experience of working with F1TENTH autonomous racing cars. More information on F1TENTH, developed by Prof. Rahul Mangharam at the University of Pennsylvania, can be found on the official website: [Official F1TENTH website](f1tenth.org "F1TENTH website").

All elements on this website are developed by [Felix Jahncke](https://www.mos.ed.tum.de/en/avs/team/felix-jahncke/ "Felix Jahncke website"), a Ph.D. student at the Autonomous Vehicle Systems (AVS) Lab, Technical University of Munich (TUM), supervised by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Johannes Betz.: [AVS website](https://www.mos.ed.tum.de/en/avs/home/ "AVS website").

In addition, multiple students developed parts of this repository during their bachelor's, semester's, or master's thesis. Contributions are acknowledged within each specific resource.

## F1TENTH - Bill of Materials Deutschland/ Germany/ EU
This document contains an Excel file with an adjusted Bill of Materials for Germany. This can also be helpful for other European Countries that can avoid tax forms. An exception is the VESC, which can only be ordered in the UK. It is indicated for each item whether it can be ordered by invoice. This process is particularly important for accounting at German universities and reduces the need to personally pay the money.

Please note that our mechanical and electrical workshops construct the platform decks and powerboards, which are not included in our Bill of Materials (BOM) at this time.

## F1TENTH - Bash Scripts
Multiple bash scripts exist to install different elements of the F1TENTH software stack, such as:
- Initial setup and ROS2 installation
- F1TENTH software stack
- ZED camera ROS2 driver

## F1TENTH - CAD Files
We have developed CAD files for specific purposes, including:
- Mounts improving the robustness and stability for the autonomy platform on the Slack chassis (no need to hot glue the standoffs any more)
- Mounting a ZED-2 camera above the LiDAR sensor

## TUM Odometry Files
This section contains tuned odometry files for all TUM F1TENTH cars. The tuning follows the official F1TENTH instructions found here: [F1TENTH Odometry Calibration](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_doc/blob/foxy_test/getting_started/driving/drive_calib_odom.rst "F1TENTH Odometry Calibration")
